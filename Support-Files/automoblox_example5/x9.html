		<li><h4>Specs</h4><p>Ha-ha is a term in garden design that refers to a trench in which one side is concealed from view, designed not to interrupt the view from a garden, pleasure-ground, or park, while maintaining a physical barrier at least in one direction, usually to keep livestock out.</p></li>
		<li><h4>Performance</h4><p>It can be also used to mean a ditch, one side of which is vertical and faced with stone, the other face sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a retaining wall, sometimes known as a "deer leap".</p></li>
		<li><h4>Reviews</h4><p>Before the advent of mechanical lawnmowers a commonly-used way to keep grass trimmed was to allow livestock, usually sheep, to graze; a ha-ha allowed them to feed on the grounds of large estates while keeping them off the lawn and gardens adjoining the house.</p></li>
